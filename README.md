## Description
NoSocialNetwork is an API for a social network web application. Use insomnia or postman to get, create, and delete users and thoughts. Users can also use post and delete routes to add or remove a friend or reaction to a thought.

## User Story and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```


## Installation
To install and use this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-network-api.git
    cd social-network-api
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Set up a MongoDB database either locally or using a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.
4. Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/socialNetworkDB
    ```
5. Start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
6. Use an API testing tool like Insomnia to interact with the API.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can test the API by making requests to the defined routes. The base URL is:
```
http://localhost:3001/api
```
You can test the API endpoints using Insomnia or Postman for different operations such as creating users, adding friends, posting thoughts, and more.
